To analyse the example file, place the jml executable in this folder.

On UNIX based systems, execute the following command:

$ ./jml -c jml.tpi.ctl -t rosa.species.trees -d tpi.phy

On windows systems, type:

$ jml -c jml.tpi.ctl -t rosa.species.trees -d tpi.phy

The program should perform 1000 simulations and then output the files "Distributions.txt", "Results.txt", and "Probabilities.txt".
